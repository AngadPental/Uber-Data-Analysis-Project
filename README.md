# Uber-Data-Analysis-Project

The following repo details my data science project on the Uber TLC FOIL Response dataset, which contains over 4.5 Million records of Uber Pickups in New York City. It is a data visualization project that uses the GGPLOT2 library in R to understand the data and develop an intuition for understanding the types of customers who avail trips.

Refer to the code (UberAnalysis.R), and PDF report for complete details. The data has also been linked here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1emopjfEkTt59jJoBH9L9bSdmlDC4AR87/view
